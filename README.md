**[3d/AR player/viewer construction of e-commerce product information using webgl]**  
This project is about simulation methods that allow us to virtually place furniture indoors over the web, rather than directly placing furniture in real-world spaces.
In more detail, users use a web server to select furniture to suit their tastes and to place it in the interior space where they are located, and to simulate furniture selection and layout online.
